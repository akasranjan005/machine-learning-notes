Machine Learning is an application of AI. The hierarchy is:
 * AI
   * Machine Learning
     * Deep Learning
     * Capsule Network
     
**Machine Learning and deep learning**

* ToDo:
  * Create Dockerfile for deploying machine learning container with all installed packages

## Data Cleaning
* Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record     set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then             replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

## Visualisation
  * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  * Plotly + cufflinks
  * [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
## Regression
* Regression is a technique used to model and analyze the relationships between variables and often times how they contribute and are related to producing a particular outcome together. A linear regression refers to a regression model that is completely made up of linear variables. Beginning with the simple case, Single Variable Linear Regression is a technique used to model the relationship between a single input independent variable (feature variable) and an output dependent variable using a linear model i.e a line.

* The more general case is Multi Variable Linear Regression where a model is created for the relationship between multiple independent input variables (feature variables) and an output dependent variable. The model remains linear in that the output is a linear combination of the input variables.

## Classification
* Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).

* For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is s binary classification since there are only 2 classes as spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In this case, known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect an unknown email.

* Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data. There are many applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.

## Deep Learning
    Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning         methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised     or unsupervised.
